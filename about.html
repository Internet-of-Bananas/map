            <p>The <em>Internet of Bananas</em> (IoB) is a critical design project in which people around the globe will
              build simple
              sensors to measure the colour of a banana and the temperature and humidity of the air around it for an
              entire week.
              During the project, researchers, tinkerers and activists around the Globe will create their own “augmented
              bananas” and track them during their lifetime, until they are rotten. The data collected by the sensors
              will then be visualised online (on Adafruit IO), where each participant will showcase the information of
              their individual banana and will be able to access a World map of the entire Internet of Bananas.
            </p>
            <h3>The Banana Jam</h3>
            <p>The IoB network will be online in <strong style="color:#ffed85;">The Banana Jam</strong>, from <span style="color:#ffed85;">5th to 12th June 2021</span>. On the first day of the Jam we will have an online Kick Starting
              Meeting, where all participants will
              introduce themselves, and connect their bananas to the sensors at the same time. During the rest of the
              week, the sensors will monitor the changes in color, temperature and humidity of the bananas and share the
              data online on IoB’s network page.</p>
            <p> On the last day of the Jam, participants will disconnect their bananas and meet for an online
              debriefing,
              where they will discuss their experiences and make plans for possible future collaborations and new
              projects.</p>
            <h3>Objectives</h3>
            <p>
              The <em>Internet of Bananas</em> is a playful response both to the hunger for data that seems to
              characterize these
              discourses and to the poor and untrustworthy implementations that are proposed by companies
              internationally.
              In particular, IoB has three main objectives:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Be Critical - IoB is a critical design project poking fun at the "Internet of Things" paradigm for its
                ideological love for data. This does not mean we are "against" IoT, but we wish to propose a critical
                approach to it that goes beyond the equation data = value;</li>
              <li>Take charge - IoB is a project of electronic literacy and citizen sensing. We believe that the
                democratisation of the sensory processes will produce data that are both more reliable and more
                meaningful.
                Despite its playful spirit, IoB aims to teach the participants how to assemble and code simple sensors
                and
                how to display and share the data collected on Adafruit IO. After the Internet of Bananas, participants
                will
                be free to use the sensors they built for whatever purpose they like, collecting and sharing sensor data
                as
                they wish.</li>
              <li>Connect - IoB aims to build an international network of people interested in critical design, citizen
                sensing and playful technologies.</li>
            </ol>
